              <p>I've spent the last 8 years in the tech industry in various capacities, including project management, develepment, and operations. No matter where I am or what the project is, <strong>I'm happiest when I'm crafting creative, comprehensive solutions</strong> to interesting problems. If a penchant for ruthless efficiency and big-picture thinking are traits you can relate to, or at least appreciate, then we'll get along just fine.</p>
              <p>In addition to providing freelance and consulting services, I presently serve as Director of Product Development for <strong>Legacy Sports, LLC</strong>, a growing multi-store Magento operation that provides fully-managed retail solutions to D3 athletic departments and other teams and organizations.</p>
              <p>I breathe music and science fiction. I thoroughly enjoy hammering away at my piano and pretending my cats have coherent thoughts, &#224; la <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/bobcats_friday" target="_blank">The Bobcats</a>. When I don't have my nose to the grindstone, you can find it sniffing around for a great craft beer or an amazing breakfast, for as the great Leslie Knope once queried, <strong>"Why would anyone ever eat anything other than breakfast food?"</strong></p>
